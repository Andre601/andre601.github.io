# About
The Shortcut allows the parsing of large text and multiple placeholders through the usage of a single placeholder.

To use this expansion will you need to create a TXT file in the `/plugins/PlaceholderAPI/shortcuts` folder and fill it with the text and/or placeholders you want to have parsed.  
You can then use `%shortcut_<filename>%` where `<filename>` is the name of the TXT file WITHOUT the `.txt` extension.

## Placeholders
- `%shortcut_<filename>%`
