# About
Supporto was a new and intuitive Ticket-Bot for Discord.  
Instead of going with the common "Type `!command` to make a new ticket" did Supporto take this concept and threw it out of the window!

Users no longer need to write a command. Instead can they just type their topic in a dedicated channel and Supporto would create a new Ticket with that message.
