# About
The Math Expansion allows you to perform various calculations of math expressions such as `1+1`.  
Supported are all expressions that the [EvalEx library](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx) can handle. PlaceholderAPI placeholders in the `{placeholder}` format are also supported!

## Placeholders
- `%math_<expression>%`
- `%math_[precision]:[rounding]_<expression>%`

> **Notes:**  
> - `[precision]` and `[rounding]` can be left blank to use the defaults set in the config of PlaceholderAPI.  
>   `[precision]` can be any whole number and `[rounding]` can be one of the [supported rounding options](https://github.com/Andre601/Math-Expansion/wiki/Config-options#rounding).
