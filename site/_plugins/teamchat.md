# About
TeamChat is a plugin that adds a separate Staff Chat which can be accessed using a configurable prefix.  
As an example: Having the prefix set to `!` would send every message starting with `!` in the Staff Chat and not the normal chat. Players need the `teamchat.chat` permission to write and see in the staff chat.

## Commands
- `/tc reload`
