# About
OneVersionRemake is a continuation of the [OneVersion](https://github.com/johnnywoof/OneVersion) plugin with improvements and new features.  
The BungeeCord/Velocity plugin allows you to define a list of versions that should be allowed access to your server. Every player that uses a version not present in the list will be denied access.

## Commands
- `/ovr help`
- `/ovr reload`
